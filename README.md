## When did this course started?
I took this training in on Aug 20, 2019, I have completed the course 2 times, meaning I have finish the entire course, coded all of the projects, then take the course again and code all of the projects, then now at the third time on Nov 21, 2019. I am rewriting all the code from scratch again. This process helpful to me because each time I review and recode the projects I have re-enforce the understanding on information on many concepts that I missed the last time.

This is very common when you are learning any thing, the first reading of a book does not give you a full understanding, you only truely understand the second sometime or the third time depend on the subject that your are learning.
